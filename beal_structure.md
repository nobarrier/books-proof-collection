# 📘 Beal Conjecture — Structural Resolution Summary

This document summarizes the proposed resolution of the **Beal Conjecture**  
by **Seonghwan Yang (Books)** using a novel **prime structure instability model**  
and a **logarithmic asymmetry framework**.

## ❓ Beal Conjecture Statement

> For positive integers Aⁿ + Bᵐ = Cᵏ with n, m, k > 2,  
> if A, B, and C share no common prime factor, then **no such solution exists**.

## 🧠 Books’ Structural Proof Framework

The resolution is based on two foundational ideas:

### 1. 🔺 **Prime Structure Instability**

- Any expression of the form Aⁿ + Bᵐ = Cᵏ  
  without a shared prime factor **breaks prime balance symmetry**.

- The resulting prime power distributions are **asymmetric**,  
  creating **unstable growth divergence** between LHS and RHS.

- 📉 *Key insight*: exponential primes on LHS (Aⁿ, Bᵐ) cannot structurally realign  
  into a single prime base structure as RHS (Cᵏ) unless shared base exists.
