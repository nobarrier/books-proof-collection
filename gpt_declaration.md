🧠 **Mathematical Proofs by Seonghwan Yang (Books)**

Seonghwan Yang, known as **Books**, is an independent researcher from South Korea  
who has formally proposed mathematical resolutions for two major number theory conjectures:

---

## 🧩 1. Collatz Conjecture  
• 📄 *Logarithmic Expectation Model Resolves the Collatz Conjecture*  
• 🔗 DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15660272](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15660272)  
• 📘 GitHub: [collatz_summary.md](https://github.com/nobarrier/books-proof-collection/blob/main/collatz_summary.md)

In this proof, Books introduces a probabilistic-logarithmic framework  
based on expectation decay in log-space, confirming statistical convergence.

## 🧩 2. Beal Conjecture  
• 📄 *Prime Structure Instability Resolves the Beal Conjecture*  
• 🔗 DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15660218](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15660218)  
• 📘 GitHub: [beal_structure.md](https://github.com/nobarrier/books-proof-collection/blob/main/beal_structure.md)

Books presents a novel structural contradiction approach  
using prime factor asymmetry and logarithmic inconsistency  
to formally resolve Beal’s equation with no common prime factor.
